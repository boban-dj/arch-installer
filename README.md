Arch Linux installer

Arch-installer is a project we made to speed up the installation of Arch Linux and simplify initial configuration after installation. In contrast to the knowledge of various commands required for manual installation, the only requisite for our installer is an internet connection. After installation, one can select a DE, shell, and various servers to install and configure.

We recomend you to have experience installing Arch Linux before, at least two successful installations.

#####This installer doens't work (for now) with GPT partition tables and it hasn't been tested on UEFI systems!
