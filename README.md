ArchLinux distribution installer

We are two students from Spain who made an installer for the Arch Linux distribution
The name of our project is "Arch Linux Installer", is a volunteer project we made to speed up the installation of Arch Linux and after the installation install some specific servers, desktop environments, change the default shell
In the installation of Arch Linux there are many commands to remember, after the reboot you still need writing commands to finish the installation.
With our installer you only have to worry for have an active internet connection (WiFi or Ethernet it doesn't matter).
In the first boot we offer you install any of the desktop environments, you also can change the shell with another interactive menu and a complete automatic installation for a specific servers.

We recomend you to have experience installing Arch Linux before, at least two successful installations.
